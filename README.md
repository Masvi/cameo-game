## 

This is a game based on [Cameo](https://www.cameo.com/), and the goal is to guess which celebrities are expensive, and which ones are cheap. 
There's no official API, so we'll grab data from cameo-explorer.netlify.app, whitch contains a scraped snapshot of some of the top celebs. 
This project was developed in the Svelte course by Rich Harris at Frontend Masters.
